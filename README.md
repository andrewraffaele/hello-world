# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub and I'm going to see how far I can go with it!

I currently bartend for a living but am ready to pursue one my passion of coding and computer programming! I love playing disc golf, listening to music and seeing bands, watching movies, playing video games, going to the shooting range, playing outside in general, and swimming.  I'm in an awesome long-term relationship and can't wait to marry this man. He pushes me to be the best I can be and is always there to support me in whatever I choose to do.  I'm a pretty lucky guy =]
